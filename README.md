## Get started 👩‍🏫

Alex Reardon has created [a free course on `egghead.io` 🥚](https://egghead.io/courses/beautiful-and-accessible-drag-and-drop-with-react-beautiful-dnd) (using [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd)) to help you get started with `@hello-pangea/dnd` as quickly as possible.

## Currently supported feature set ✅

- Vertical lists ↕
- Horizontal lists ↔
- Movement between lists (▤ ↔ ▤)
- [Virtual list support 👾](/docs/patterns/virtual-lists.md) - unlocking 10,000 items @ 60fps
- [Combining items](/docs/guides/combining.md)
- Mouse 🐭, keyboard 🎹♿️ and touch 👉📱 (mobile, tablet and so on) support
- [Multi drag support](/docs/patterns/multi-drag.md)
- Incredible screen reader support ♿️ - we provide an amazing experience for english screen readers out of the box 📦. We also provide complete customisation control and internationalisation support for those who need it 💖
- [Conditional dragging](/docs/api/draggable.md#optional-props) and [conditional dropping](/docs/api/droppable.md#conditionally-dropping)
- Multiple independent lists on the one page
- Flexible item sizes - the draggable items can have different heights (vertical lists) or widths (horizontal lists)
- [Add and remove items during a drag](/docs/guides/changes-while-dragging.md)
- Compatible with semantic `<table>` reordering - [table pattern](/docs/patterns/tables.md)
- [Auto scrolling](/docs/guides/auto-scrolling.md) - automatically scroll containers and the window as required during a drag (even with keyboard 🔥)
- Custom drag handles - you can drag a whole item by just a part of it
- Able to move the dragging item to another element while dragging (clone, portal) - [Reparenting your `<Draggable />`](/docs/guides/reparenting.md)
- [Create scripted drag and drop experiences 🎮](/docs/sensors/sensor-api.md)
- Allows extensions to support for [any input type you like 🕹](/docs/sensors/sensor-api.md)
- 🌲 Tree support through the [`@atlaskit/tree`](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/packages/confluence/tree) package
- A `<Droppable />` list can be a scroll container (without a scrollable parent) or be the child of a scroll container (that also does not have a scrollable parent)
- Independent nested lists - a list can be a child of another list, but you cannot drag items from the parent list into a child list
- Server side rendering (SSR) compatible
- Plays well with [nested interactive elements](/docs/api/draggable.md#interactive-child-elements-within-a-draggable-) by default

## Motivation 🤔

`@hello-pangea/dnd` exists to create beautiful drag and drop for lists that anyone can use - even people who cannot see. For a good overview of the history and motivations of the project you can take a look at these external resources:

- 📖 [Rethinking drag and drop](https://medium.com/@alexandereardon/rethinking-drag-and-drop-d9f5770b4e6b)
- 🎧 [React podcast: fast, accessible and beautiful drag and drop](https://reactpodcast.simplecast.fm/17)

## Not for everyone ✌️

There are a lot of libraries out there that allow for drag and drop interactions within React. Most notable of these is the amazing [`react-dnd`](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd). It does an incredible job at providing a great set of drag and drop primitives which work especially well with the [wildly inconsistent](https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2009/09/the_html5_drag.html) html5 drag and drop feature. `@hello-pangea/dnd` is a higher level abstraction specifically built for lists (vertical, horizontal, movement between lists, nested lists and so on). Within that subset of functionality `@hello-pangea/dnd` offers a powerful, natural and beautiful drag and drop experience. However, it does not provide the breadth of functionality offered by `react-dnd`. One shortcoming is that grid layouts are not supported (yet). So `@hello-pangea/dnd` might not be for you depending on what your use case is.
