# Touch dragging

`react-forked-dnd` supports dragging on touch devices such as mobiles and tablets.

## Understanding intention: tap, force press, scroll and drag

When a user presses their finger (or other input) on a `<Draggable />` we are not sure if they where intending to _tap_, _force press_, _scroll the container_ or _drag_. **As much as possible `react-forked-dnd` aims to ensure that a users default interaction experience remains unaffected**.

> To see more indepth information about how we impact standard browser events see our [how we use DOM events guide](/docs/guides/how-we-use-dom-events.md)

## Starting a drag: long press

A user can start a drag by holding their finger 👇 on an element for a small period of time 🕑 (long press)

## Tap support

If the user lifts their finger before the timer is finished then we release the event to the browser for it to determine whether to perform the standard tap / click action. This allows you to have a `<Draggable />` that is both clickable such as a anchor as well as draggable. If the item was dragged then we block the tap action from occurring.

## Native scrolling support

If we detect a `touchmove` before the long press timer expires we cancel the pending drag and allow the user to scroll normally. This means that the user needs to be fairly intentional and precise with their grabbing. Once the first `touchmove` occurs we have to either opt in or out of native scrolling.

- If the long press timer **has not** expired: _allow native scrolling and prevent dragging_
- If the long press timer **has** expired: _a drag has started and we prevent native scrolling_

## Force press support

> See our [force press guide](/docs/api/draggable.md)

## Vibration

> This is merely an idea - it is up to you to add this if you want this behavior.

If you like you could also trigger a [vibration event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Vibration_API) when the user picks up a `<Draggable />`. This can provide tactile feedback that the user is doing something. It currently is only supported in Chrome on Android.

```js
class App extends React.Component {
  onDragStart = () => {
    // good times
    if (window.navigator.vibrate) {
      window.navigator.vibrate(100);
    }
  };
  /*...*/
}
```
