# Browser focus

`@react-forked/dnd` includes logic to maintain browser focus for _drag handles_. This especially important for [keyboard dragging](/docs/sensors/keyboard.md) which requires the dragging item to be focused.

## Terminology reminder üìñ

A `<Draggable />` has a _drag handle_. A _drag handle_ is the part of the `<Draggable />` that controls the dragging of the whole `<Draggable />`. A _drag handle_ can be the same element as the `<Draggable />`

## Drag handle not focused at drag start

If the _drag handle_ is not focused when a drag starts then **focus is not given** to the dragging item. This is a mirror of the native HTML5 drag and drop behaviour which does not give focus to an item just because it is dragging. You are welcome to call `HTMLElement.focus()` when a drag starts to give it focus, but that is up to you.

## Drag handle is focused at drag start

If a _drag handle_ has browser focus when a drag starts then `rfd` will try to give focus to the _drag handle_ during a drag and just after a drag ends.

Here is what is done:

- Give focus to a _drag handle_ with a matching `DraggableId` after the drag starts. This might be a different element to the original _drag handle_ if you are [reparenting your `<Draggable />`](/docs/guides/reparenting.md).
- Give focus to a _drag handle_ with a matching `DraggableId` after the drag ends. Sometimes the original _drag handle_ element is lost during a drag, such as when [reparenting your `<Draggable />`](/docs/guides/reparenting.md), or when moving a `<Draggable />` from one list to another as `React` will recreate the element.
- If [combining](/docs/guides/combining.md) then focus is given to the combine target after a drag ends. This allows keyboard users to continue to engage with the application without needing to get the focus back to where they where the last interaction was

## Browser testing

Fun fact: we test this behaviour using [`cypress.io`](http://cypress.io) to ensure that focus management behaves as we expect
