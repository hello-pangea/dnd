# Common setup issues

This is a little guide to help you with some common setup issues

## Check your `console`

For detectable setup issues we try to log information in the `console` for `development` builds of `@react-forked/dnd`. If things are not working, first thing to do is check your `console`.

## React version

Please ensure that you meet our peer dependency version of `React`. Your React version needs to be greater than or equal to `16.8.5`.

If you want to know what React version you are on take a look at your [`package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) or use `console.log(React.version)`.

If you are not sure if your `package.json` version satisfies `16.8.5` have a read of [npm: about semantic versioning](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning) and try out the [npm sermver calculator](https://semver.npmjs.com/)

## No duplicate ids

`draggableId` and `droppableId` values must be unique for the whole `<DragDropContext />` and not just a list.

More information: [identifiers guide](/docs/guides/identifiers.md)

## `<Draggable />` indexes

Rules:

- Must be unique within a `<Droppable />` (no duplicates)
- Must be consecutive. `[0, 1, 2]` and not `[1, 2, 8]`

Indexes do not need to start from `0` (this is often the case in [virtual lists](/docs/patterns/virtual-lists.md))

[More information](/docs/api/draggable.md#draggable-props)

## No margin collapsing between `<Draggable />`s

This can happen if you have a `margin-top` as well as a `margin-bottom` on a `<Draggable />`.

[More information](/docs/api/draggable.md#unsupported-margin-setups)

## `key`s for a list of `<Draggable />`

If you are rendering a list of `<Draggable />`s then it is important that you add a [`key`](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html) prop to each `<Draggable />`.

```js
return items.map((item, index) => (
  <Draggable
    // adding a key is important!
    key={item.id}
    draggableId={item.id}
    index={index}
  >
    {(provided, snapshot) => (
      <div
        ref={provided.innerRef}
        {...provided.draggableProps}
        {...provided.dragHandleProps}
      >
        {item.content}
      </div>
    )}
  </Draggable>
));
```

## Avoid empty lists

We recommend you set a `min-height` or `min-width` on a `<Droppable />` to ensure that there is a visible drop target when a list is empty

We go over this in our [Get started with `@react-forked/dnd` course](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-move-items-between-columns-with-react-beautiful-dnd-using-ondragend) (This is using [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd))

## Image flickering in a `<Draggable />`

See our [avoiding image flickering guide](/docs/guides/avoiding-image-flickering.md)
