# Identifiers (ids)

> `<Draggable /> > draggableId` and `<Droppable /> > droppableId`

A `<Draggable />` and a `<Droppable />` have an id. These are `draggableId` and `droppableId` respectively.

## String

We expect an id to be a `string`

```js
type Id = string;
type DroppableId = Id;
type DraggableId = Id;
```

## Ids must be unique

A id must uniquely identify a `<Draggable />` or `<Droppable />` within a `<DragDropContext />`. So if you have multiple connected lists, each `<Droppable />` needs to have a unique id and each `<Draggable />` needs to have a unique id, even if the item is in a different list.

The id must also be unique even if the `type` argument on the `<Droppable />` is different.

## Ids must be a string

Right now it is important that all `Id`'s be strings. `rfd` will throw an error if an `Id` is not a string.

## Avoid reusing ids

For simplicity, it is best to avoid changing a `draggableId` or `droppableId` when a reorder occurs. The safest option is to associate an id with a piece of data and do not update the id between reorders.

You can change the `draggableId` or `droppableId` at any time except during a drag. Including after reorder. However, to avoid an exception you need to avoid reusing id's between two components. This can happen if you base a draggableId or droppableId on an index.

### What this looks like internally

#### 1. Update droppable

old droppableId: "droppable-0"
new droppableId: "droppable-1"

👉 delete reference to "droppable-0"
👉 add reference to "droppable-1"

#### 2. Update droppable

old droppableId: "droppable-1" 😢
new droppableId: "droppable-2"

👉 delete reference to "droppable-1" 😢 (will remove reference to our new "droppable-1")
👉 add a reference to "droppable-2"

#### 3. Update droppable

old droppableId: "droppable-1" 💥
new droppableId: "droppable-5"

👉 delete reference to "droppable-1" 💥 (will cause an exception because "droppable-1" is not found)

## Could we change these rules?

Yep!

But we do things this way for simplicity and performance. Feel free to continue this conversation in a Github issue if you feel strongly about it.
