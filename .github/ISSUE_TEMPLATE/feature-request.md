<!--
## Keep in mind: our scope

This is not a general purpose drag and drop library and is attempting to create an experience that is more physical than standard drag and drop interactions on the web.

Before raising a new feature please ensure that it falls within the philosophy of the library.

https://github.com/react-forked/dnd/blob/master/docs/about/design-principles.md#foundational-idea-physicality

All features need to have a clear and generally applicable keyboard interaction pattern in order for us to deliver on our core goal of being highly accessible.
